<p>Oh my god. This is my favorite Samantha Young book yet!!! It had everything. I was on a six hour drive so I listened
    to most of it. My heart broke with the angst and I loved the characters - almost teared up while driving down the
    highway.</p>

<p>I am happy that I randomly read Samantha Young’s first Play On novel. I couldn’t wait to read this one to see if I
    would like her writing. I do! I think she does an excellent job at capturing the emotions of characters, leaves you
    wanting to know more about them. I love a good healing journey and you can tell Young took her time to develop good
    stories for the characters. I was surprised in one part and then it became predictable towards the end. I didn’t
    mind it though because the story started with shattered pieces and Young pulled it all together in the end.</p>

<p>Smut level: 4/5</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this one! Not quite as much as the first in this series as that completely blew me away but I still
    loved all the characters and the storyline. Samantha Young has quickly become one of my favourite authors and I am a
    huge fan of everything she writes as she has this amazing way of making you connect with her characters and story.
    Loved it.</p>
