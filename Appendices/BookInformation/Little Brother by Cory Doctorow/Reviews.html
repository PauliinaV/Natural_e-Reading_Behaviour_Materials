<p>I'm having a hard time rating this one. There were parts that I liked and parts that I hated. Some of the technical
    parts were a little heavy and I found myself skimming them, but other explanations I enjoyed. Sometimes I liked
    Marcus and sometimes he drove me nuts. Overall, it was a good story and interesting to ponder if it could ever come
    true. I liked it enough that I'm going to try the second one, but I hope the characters have a bit more depth to
    them in the second book.</p>

<p>Relevant, educational and entertaining in 2021. The book could be seen as honouring and updating 1984 for the
    Internet age. We are constantly battling to maintain freedoms and privacy. Marcusâ€™ journey shows how the 17 year old
    idealism and backbone in all of us is needed. Do recommend.</p>
