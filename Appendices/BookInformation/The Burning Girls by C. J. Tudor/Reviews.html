<p>August 5th 2021, review by Amanda:</p>
<p>3 stars</p>
<p>That one was a bit slow. The large cast of characters was great for hiding the "bad guy," and I liked that the
    characters were complex, not fully good or bad, smart or dumb. But it took a long time to read, and the end was just
    jam packed with reveals. I would have preferred better pacing.</p>

<ul>
    <li>CREEPY and folk-y suspense with tons of layers</li>
    <li>compelling characters</li>
    <li>the ending though </li>
</ul>
<p>If you like chilling suspense, small town churches, and tons of well written twists... this book is for you! I also
    highly recommend her other books, The Chalk Man and The Other People.</p>

<p>This was quite good. Quite a mystery. Kept me in the dark until the end.</p>
