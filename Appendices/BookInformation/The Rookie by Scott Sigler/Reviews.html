<p>To be honest when I started to read this I was worried it would be a bit much. A whole no universe to learn can be a
    lot lol. However the way this book is written it reminds you as you go. The differant aliens are often discribed so
    over time it becomes much easier to picture them. The history is something I was worried about too, but never comes
    up like you think it would, just what you need to keep the story going. Very well written and easy to follow (even
    if you do not like football, but then again who doesnt lol). Lots of fun and twists along the way. Very discriptive
    which makes you feel like you are right there with the characters. Very well done. Have to get the rest of the set
    now.</p>
