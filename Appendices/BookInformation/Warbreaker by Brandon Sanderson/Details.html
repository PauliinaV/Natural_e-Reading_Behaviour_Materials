<p><b>About the author:</b></p>
<p>Brandon Sanderson was born in 1975 in Lincoln, Nebraska. As a child Brandon enjoyed reading, but he lost interest in
    the types of titles often suggested to him, and by junior high he never cracked a book if he could help it. This
    changed when an eighth grade teacher gave him Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly.</p>

<p>The only author to make the short list for the David Gemmell Legend Award six times in four years, Brandon won that
    award in 2011 for The Way of Kings. The Emperorâ€™s Soul won the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Novella. He has appeared on
    the New York Times Best-Seller List multiple times, with five novels hitting the #1 spot.</p>

<p>Currently living in Utah with his wife and children, Brandon teaches creative writing at Brigham Young University</p>
