<p>July 25th 2021, review by Jesus:</p>
<p>3.7 stars</p>
<p>Sooo yeah... it was aight I guess? As usual with Brandon the world building is nice and there and some interesting
    characters. Two characters I was disappointed in the direction they were written. Two main sisters honestly kinda
    boring.</p>
<p>It was definitely a fun read! I was just disappointed in the direction many things went (characters, villains etc..)
    as well as not liking the pacing at all. First 30% was super slow then out of nowhere things picked up (The
    Sanderson Avalanche Effect). Loved how well everything was moving past 30%...but towards the last 75-90% it just
    felt soooo rushed.</p>

<p>4 stars</p>
<p>Gender roles and a rushed ending prevented an awesome magic system and complex characters from allowing this book to
    be as good as it could have been. 3.5 stars rounded up.</p>

<p>I have recommended this book to those who want to start reading fantasy books but don't want anything too heavy.
    Romance, kingdoms, subterfuge and twists. Great book!!!</p>
