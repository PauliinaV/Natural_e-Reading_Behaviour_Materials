<p>3 stars</p>
<p>This book was SO different than I expected it to be. The author’s introduction & preface were great. I was pleasantly
    surprised by how readable this book was. I expected it to be a dense scary book, but instead it was a lively, quick
    paced almost ‘love story’.</p>

<p>Mary Shelley is a genius and a girl boss. Argue with the wall.</p>
