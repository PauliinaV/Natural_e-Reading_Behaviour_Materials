<p>July 4th 2021, review by Bob:</p>
<p>4 stars</p>
<p>Short for McDermid. A stand-alone story about gangland murders rather than serial killings. She does nasties like
    no-one else.</p>

<p>November 14th 2020, review by Susan Abbey:</p>
<p>5 stars</p>
<p>A great short read, with typical McDermid twists and turns involving drug lords and gangsters with police, stumped on
    why so many enemies of a Farlowe are now turning up dead - given he is believed to have committed suicide.</p>
