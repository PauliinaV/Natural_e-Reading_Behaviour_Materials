<p><b>About the author:</b></p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania on November 29, 1832. She and her three sisters, Anna,
    Elizabeth and May were educated by their father, philosopher/ teacher, Bronson Alcott and raised on the practical
    Christianity of their mother, Abigail May. Louisa spent her childhood in Boston and in Concord, Massachusetts, where
    her days were enlightened by visits to Ralph Waldo Emerson’s library, excursions into nature with Henry David
    Thoreau and theatricals in the barn at Hillside (now Hawthorne’s "Wayside"). In all, Louisa published over 30 books
    and collections of stories. She died on March 6, 1888, only two days after her father, and is buried in Sleepy
    Hollow Cemetery in Concord.</p>
