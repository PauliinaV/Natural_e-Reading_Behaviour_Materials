<p>July 25th 2021, review by Phyllis Pumpernickel:</p>
<p>5 stars</p>
<p>AMAZING NOVEL. It is so wholesome and feel-good, but also has a great plot. It is jam-packed with family values and
    good amount of romance that does not disappoint. This book changed my perspective on life. It taught me to be more
    content and grateful with the things I have. It also teaches you how to be a kind, good person in general. Not to
    mention, along with her strong sense of morals, Louisa May Alcott is extremely witty and there were moments in the
    book where I laughed out LOUD. Go read this book now. When you finish it you will feel so proud of yourself.</p>
