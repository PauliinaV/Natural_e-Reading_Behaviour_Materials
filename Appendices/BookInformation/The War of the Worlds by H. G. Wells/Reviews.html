<p>July 27th 2021, review by Jaime:</p>
<p>5 stars</p>
<p>I was gonna give it four stars as it's good but not as good as everyone expectation's make you think it will be, but
    I give it five because the idea of reading this story on the radio for the first time as if it were true keeps
    driving me crazy. Such a genius.</p>

<p>3 stars</p>
<p>It was quite a challenging read, though I shouldn't be saying that about this book as a 25 year old.</p>
<p>This loses a few stars for me because it took me a while to finish, was quite slow for me, but the action was good. I
    also liked the reference to places in London and Surrey, it provided me with a visual representation of where the
    events took place.</p>

<p>4 stars</p>
<p>Classic</p>
<p>Good story. Love the first person framing. Wish there was a version with a more modern dialect. Definitely gotta
    reread in a year.</p>
