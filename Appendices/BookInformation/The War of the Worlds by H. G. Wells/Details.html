<p><b>About the author:</b></p>
<p>Herbert George Wells was born to a working class family in Kent, England. Young Wells received a spotty education,
    interrupted by several illnesses and family difficulties, and became a draper's apprentice as a teenager. The
    headmaster of Midhurst Grammar School, where he had spent a year, arranged for him to return as an "usher," or
    student teacher. Wells earned a government scholarship in 1884, to study biology under Thomas Henry Huxley at the
    Normal School of Science. Wells earned his bachelor of science and doctor of science degrees at the University of
    London. After marrying his cousin, Isabel, Wells began to supplement his teaching salary with short stories and
    freelance articles, then books, including <i>The Time Machine</i> (1895), <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> (1896),
    <i>The Invisible Man</i> (1897), and <i>The War of the Worlds</i> (1898).</p>

<p>Wells created a mild scandal when he divorced his cousin to marry one of his best students, Amy Catherine Robbins.
    Although his second marriage was lasting and produced two sons, Wells was an unabashed advocate of free (as opposed
    to "indiscriminate") love. He continued to openly have extra-marital liaisons, most famously with Margaret Sanger,
    and a ten-year relationship with the author Rebecca West, who had one of his two out-of-wedlock children. A one-time
    member of the Fabian Society, Wells sought active change. His 100 books included many novels, as well as nonfiction,
    such as A Modern Utopia (1905), The Outline of History (1920), A Short History of the World (1922), The Shape of
    Things to Come (1933), and The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1932). One of his booklets was Crux Ansata, An
    Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church. Although Wells toyed briefly with the idea of a "divine will" in his book,
    God the Invisible King (1917), it was a temporary aberration. Wells used his international fame to promote his
    favorite causes, including the prevention of war, and was received by government officials around the world. He is
    best-remembered as an early writer of science fiction and futurism.</p>

<p>He was also an outspoken socialist. Wells and Jules Verne are each sometimes referred to as "The Fathers of Science
    Fiction". D. 1946.</p>
