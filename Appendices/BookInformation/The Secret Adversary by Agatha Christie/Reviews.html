<p>I was about to write that I guessed the mystery halfway through, but you never should underappreciate Agatha
    Christie. I loved the twist. However, I could not connect with the characters at all and did not care about their
    love lives. I would love to see more badass moments from the main female character, but as always, due to the old
    days, I guess writers could not develop more character into the female lead.</p>

<p>I had read this e-book out of curiosity. I enjoyed reading this book because of the drama and the mystery. I loved
    that the story because of the twists and turns that kept me guessing. I thought the novel was well written.</p>

<p>3 stars</p>
<p>This was a fun, quick read. It was written in the early 1920s and the slang of that time…. “old thing” “chew a bun”
    “cat in a rage” “put me wise” “you’re so darn plucky”….was very distracting to me. Kind of irritating. It was like
    those old Katherine Hepburn movies where they talk a mile a minute. But still, it was a good story and I kept going
    back and forth as to who Mr Brown was and every time I was sure, I would change my mind! Christie always tricks me!
    This was no exception.</p>
