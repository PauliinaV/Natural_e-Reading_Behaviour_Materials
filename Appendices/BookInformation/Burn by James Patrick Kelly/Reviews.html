    Itâ€™s an interesting blend of inspirations, Walden and the Dalai Lama and Backdraft and suicide bombers. Comes
    together nicely.

    This novella wasn't at all a bad read, I did enjoy it, but it desperately wanted to be a full novel (or perhaps even
    the start of a series). From beginning to end, there were new details about the universe being introduced constantly
    that often didn't contribute much to the plot. If this were part of a larger series, it would make sense, but
    instead it left me kind of disappointed at the ending.

    Very well written, but not what you'd call a happy book.
