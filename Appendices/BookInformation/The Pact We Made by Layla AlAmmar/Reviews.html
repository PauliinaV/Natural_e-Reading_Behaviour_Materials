<p>April 11th 2021, review by shabrina fadhilah:</p>
<p>4 stars</p>
<p>I gave 4 stars because I can relate to dahlia, our main character in this book. I have the same frustration & angst,
    just like her. I think Dahlia is “some of us”. So this book somehow validates my existence lol.</p>

<p>3 stars</p>
<p>Aside from the question of representation and whether this was accurate, and aside from the fact that the writing
    style was quite beautiful, i felt like this very obviously carters to a Western audience. I read it as perpetuating
    the idea of the East being stifling and oppressive and the West as the place of liberation and freedom.</p>

<p>5 stars</p>
<p>This was such an interesting book. We can't comprehend in a western world the expectations on women in a country like
    Kuwait. The lacknof choices they can make for themselves for even the simplest of things.</p>
