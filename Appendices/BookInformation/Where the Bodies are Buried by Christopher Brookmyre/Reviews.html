<p>Story was decent but I've listened to and read better by the author for me 3 out of 5</p>

<p>4 stars</p>
<p>A little more grim and gritty, a little less funny than one usually expects from Brookmyre, but every bit as good.

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve been introduced to such colorful characters. First, we have Jasmine, a self described
    screw up who has been reduced to helping her uncle with his PI business in Glasgow. Then, we have Catherine, a
    Detective Superintendent . “Catherine had often taken an odd kind of solace from considering her job analogous with
    that of the binmen of Glasgow.” I adored both of them - Jasmine forced to learn on the fly when her uncle goes
    missing and Catherine, trying to maneuver through police politics having missed out on a promotion she thought
    should have been hers.</p>
<p>This book packs on the humor with many turns of phrase. Brookmyre has a real knack for descriptions. The book moves
    at a strong, steady pace with no down time. The story alternates between the two women and it’s a long while before
    their stories intersect. And it’s not at all apparent how they will. But it’s a great twist when it does.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to see this is the first in a series as I will definitely check out the later books.</p>
