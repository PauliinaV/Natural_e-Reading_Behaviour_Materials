<p>Phenomenal read. I was captivated from start to finish.</p>

<p>There was no ending. I get what the author was trying to do, but it felt very rushed and like the author was trying
    too hard to be dramatic. Otherwise, it was a good read.</p>

<p>Well written and enjoyable but I can't help believing its all a little far fetched. The nuance that I found in Hamnet
    just wasn't there, the beautiful is found in the small moments and I just feel this story had to many big surprises
    around the corner</p>
